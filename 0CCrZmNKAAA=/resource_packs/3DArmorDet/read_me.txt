3D Armor Details - Update #2 by Rejixide

If you want to use the models to your texture pack that isn't in 16x resolution, you're gonna need a photo editing software. (e.g. Adobe Photoshop)

IMPORTANT #1: Only the first armor texture files are holding the 3D Details. (textures\models\armor\diamond_1.png or ...leather_1.png)
IMPORTANT #2: Every 3D Armor Detail is attached solely to a piece by default, but this can be changed. 

## RECOLORING AND RE-RELEASING THIS PACK IS ONLY ALLOWED WITH MY APPROVAL ##
############## YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MODIFY THE 3D MODELS #################
